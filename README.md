# Hi!

The name's [Eldred, Eldred Habert](https://eldred.fr).

I mainly deal with lower-level stuff, and making tools to help others make great stuff out of them.
I'm a regular over at [gbdev](https://github.com/gbdev), if you're interested in making a game on a retro platform for fun, this might be worth checking out!

I'm the main maintainer of [RGBDS](https://github.com/gbdev/rgbds), the main toolchain for programming on the Game Boy.
If you're interested in contributing, we have [some beginner-friendly tasks](https://github.com/gbdev/rgbds/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Abeginner-friendly)!

I have a [Game Boy programming tutorial](https://eldred.fr/gb-asm-tutorial) in progress; if you're interested in translating it, you can!
[Please open an issue](https://github.com/ISSOtm/gb-asm-tutorial/issues) to let me know, and we can get started :)

Thanks for stopping by, have fun on the rest of your browsing journey o/
